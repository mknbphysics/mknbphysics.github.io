<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" width = "450" height="450" padding="5px">
<p>
I am a 3rd year Physics Ph.D student at QMUL, London. I have a BS-MS Dual Degree in Physics from IISER Bhopal, India. 
I hail from Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India, home to one of the oldest language in the world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language">Tamizh</a>, a beautiful language described by scholars as being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqbLovThG0I">language formulated by Lawyers and poets </a>. 
Outside of physics, I play chess (poorly), lift weights and enjoy running short-medium distances. I am also interested in history of religions, major wars and current conflicts.

<h2>Research interests</h2>
<li>Generalized symmetries</li>
<p>
I am interested in understanding the structure of generalized symmetries and their avatars in settings of quantum field theories and phases of matter.
A Quantum theory of fields or phases of matter is defined in its most generality, as a regularizable (i.e. ability to pick infinities) algebra of operators (read distributions). 
In this language, symmetries organize operators and their algebra. 
Going further, generalized symmetries is a geometric-algebraic approach to symmetries, which we define as the sub-algebra of topological operators in the spectrum.
Anomalies of generalized symmetries are a result of projective action of these symmetries, and the inability to gauge these symmetries quantum-mechanically.
This language allows us to bring a lot of inter-related concepts into a bigger umbrella, clarify subtle issues, and provides clear directions to attack. 
</p>
<li>Extended operators in quantum field theories</li>
<p>
Traditional approaches to QFTs have mostly been focused on path integrals written with local operators. While extended operators have played crucial role in condensed matter physics (for e.g. Kondo effect), only recently have we started appreciating conceptual roles played by extended operators in QFT. Probe limits of extended brane amplitudes compute semi-classical entanglement entropy between two regions, motivations from string theory suggest that UV complete QFT and Quantum gravity are rich with extended objects with their own worldvolume theories. I am interested in understanding universal structure of low-dimensional extended operators (which furnish interesting boundary conditions), the general interplay between bulk and the extended operators, and their algebraic structure. Note that generalized symmetry operators form a nice topological subsector of this class of operators.

<h2>Papers</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Non-invertible symmetries and their gauging in 2+1d, and Toric code symmetry zoo</a></li>
<p>
In preparation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSYpxo7behA">Writing tune</a>.
</p>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21066">3d N=4 Mirror Symmetry, TQFTs, and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching</a></li>
<p>
In this article, we study Universal deformation of 3d N=4 Abelian gauge theories and matter charges with arbitrary integer charges. 
We prove that 3d N=4 mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these spin-TQFTs. We explain how to match
't Hooft anomalies for global symmetries in the UV SCFT and the IR spin-TQFT. Using our anomaly matching discussion, we describe how 
to connect, via the renormalization group, abstract local unitary 3d N=4 SCFTs with certain 't Hooft anomalies for their internal symmetries to IR phases (partially) described by Abelian spin Chern-Simons theories.

<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00866">On the Classification of Bosonic and Fermionic One-Form Symmetries in 2+1d and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching </a></li>
<p>
In this article, we classify 3d Unitary bosonic and spin TQFTs with bosonic and fermionic topological spins using Frobenius-Schur indicator. We then explore topological subsectors of unitary 3d QFTs and employ categorical tools to track changes to this sector under RG Flow.
</p>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06446">On-shell Supersymmetry and higher-spin amplitudes</a></li>
<p>
In this paper, we construct analytic expressions for tree-level four point functions of massless particles with higher spin exchanges in N=1,2, and 4 SUSY in 4d. We use the technique of on-shell supersymmetry using spinor helicity to compute super-amplitudes.
</p>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05301">Spinning amplitudes from scalar amplitudes</a></li>
<p>
In this paper, we construct a differential operators on the space of four point amplitudes and use it to obtain exact analytic expression massless particles in any dimension greater than or equal to 4. We explicitly show that these amplitudes factorize as Kinetic factors and Wigner Polynomials in the center of mass frame.
