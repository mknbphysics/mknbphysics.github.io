        	<p>
		I am a 3rd year Physics Ph.D student at QMUL, London. I have a BS-MS Dual Degree in Physics from IISER Bhopal, India. I hail from Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India, home to one of the oldest language in the world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language">Tamizh</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqbLovThG0I">a beautiful language described by scholars as formulated by Lawyers and poets </a>. 
		Currently, I am interested in understanding the structure of generalized symmetries and their avatars in settings of quantum field theories and phases of matter.
		</p>

		<p>
		A Quantum theory of fields or phases of matter is defined in its most generality, as a regularizable (i.e. ability to pick infinities) algebra of operators (read distributions). 
		In this language, symmetries organize operators and their algebra. 
		Going further, generalized symmetries is a geometric-algebraic approach to symmetries, which we define as the sub-algebra of topological operators in the spectrum.
		Anomalies of generalized symmetries are a result of projective action of these symmetries, and the inability to gauge these symmetries quantum-mechanically.
		This language allows us to bring a lot of inter-related concepts into a bigger umbrella, clarify subtle issues, and provides clear directions to attack. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Previously, I also did some work on scattering amplitudes in massive higher theories, as an approach to understanding some perturbative details of quantum gravity.
		Outside of physics, I play chess (poorly), lift weights and enjoy running short-medium distances. I am also interested in history of religions, major wars and current conflicts.

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00866">On the Classification of Bosonic and Fermionic One-Form Symmetries in 2+1d and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching </a></li>
		<p>
		In this article, we classify 3d Unitary bosonic and spin TQFTs with bosonic and fermionic topological spins using Frobenius-Schur indicator. We then explore topological subsectors of unitary 3d QFTs and employ categorical tools to track changes to this sector under RG Flow.

                <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06446">On-shell Supersymmetry and higher-spin amplitudes</a></li>
		<p>
		In this paper, we construct analytic expressions for tree-level four point functions of massless particles with higher spin exchanges in N=1,2, and 4 SUSY in 4d. We use the technique of on-shell supersymmetry using spinor helicity to compute super-amplitudes.
		</p>
                <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05301">Spinning amplitudes from scalar amplitudes</a></li>
		<p>
		In this paper, we construct a differential operators on the space of four point amplitudes and use it to obtain exact analytic expression massless particles in any dimension greater than or equal to 4. We explicitly show that these amplitudes factorize as Kinetic factors and Wigner Polynomials in the center of mass frame.
